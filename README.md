# DungBeetleApp
Digital material warehouse and deconstruction analysis tool.

This is a part of a scientifc project under the umbrella of University Liechtenstein, Department of Architecture.
Aim of the project is to develop tools supporting material re-use and circularity in building's lifecycle. 

The DungBeetleApp wouldn't be possible without tremendous work done by IfcOpenShell, IFCjs and Streamlit developers. 
Thank you all for your support!
