            Transition from linear (take, make, dispose) towards circular economy (make, use, recycle) is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving a sustainable growth and limiting global warming.
        Digitalization and management of material flows play a central role in the circular economy. Construction and demolition waste is particularly important, as it is the largest waste stream in many developed countries,
        e.g. in the EU, USA, Australia, China and Switzerland. In the world of digital transformation, a BIM model is a digital representation of a physical asset. Such virtual material banks hold enormous potential for
        innovation in sustainable design, (de-)construction, finance and investment related to the built environment.
        Dung Beetle is a research project exploring possibilities of using BIM models to analyse deconstruction potential of buildings and to use BIM data as a basis for digital material banks. 

        Would you like to find out more or find out how much re-use potential does your own building project have? Get in touch with us: piotr.piotrowski[at]uni.li, or just go ahead and upload your IFC4 MVD: Reference View file 
        and check the results.
